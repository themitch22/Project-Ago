# Project-Ago
(Ago - Latin Singular Indicitive; To do, drive, lead; pass or spend time) 

A Small portable delta 3D printer using CNC routed ACM 

Project goals:
- Using ACM (DiBond, Alubond) sheets to create the main chassis of the printer with a CNC router.
- Using a Rostock/Kossel derivative design delta printer. 
- Make it portable; add a handle, spool holder, run from various power sources (DC battery/power supply).
- Take up the least ammount of table space possible (allow it to fit anywhere without the need for excessive wires and external accessories)
- Have a usable print volume for most practical 3D printing (160-200mm dia., 150-200mm height).
- Make the 3D printable components printable on most printers without support material. 
- Modular design to fit most RepRap components to allow for various levels of pricing and options.
